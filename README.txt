Run SPOT Run is a breakout board for the SPOT Connect version of the SPOT Geolocator. This repository includes the engineering design files for the breakout board and an example Arduino v1.0 Sketch to run the board.

You will need your own registered SPOT ($150 for the hardware, $100 for the subscription), but after that, you should be able to broadcast small text messages (up to 40 characters) from most land masses on the globe.
