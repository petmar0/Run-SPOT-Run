Run SPOT Run is a breakout board for the SPOT Connect version of the SPOT Geolocator. It is now retired on the SparkFun store front.

You will need your own registered SPOT ($150 for the hardware, $100 for the subscription), but after that, you should be able to broadcast small text messages (up to 40 characters) from most land masses on the globe.

Please see this [tutorial](http://www.sparkfun.com/tutorials/340) for more information. 

The hardware files were designed in Eagle v6.1.0 , and the firmware was developed in Arduino v1.0.
